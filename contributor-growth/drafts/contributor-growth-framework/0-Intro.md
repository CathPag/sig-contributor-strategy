# Contributor Growth Framework
The goal of this framework is to help open source projects develop workflows, processes, and habits that incentivize users to become long-term active and engaged members of your community. 

The first version of this document summarizes the experience different project maintainers have gathered over the past years (chronologically ordered by interview): **Paris Pittman** (Kubernetes maintainer, Apple), **Carlisia Thompson** (Velero maintainer, VMware), **Aaron Schlesinger** (The Athens Project maintainer, Microsoft), **Stephen Augustus** (Kubernetes maintainer, VMware), **Charles Pretzer** (Linkerd maintainer, Buoyant), **Phil Estes** (Containerd maintainer, AWS)

**NOTE:** We want this to be a living document where projects keep updating and adding new ideas as their experience grows. If you've learned something other projects can benefit from, please submit a PR with your advice. 

This framework has five independent sections, so feel free to jump into whichever section interests you most.

1. Motivating users to contribute
2. A successful PR workflow 
3. Keeping contributors engaged after their first contribution 
4. Incentivizing contributors to move up the ladder
5. Incentivizing non-code contributions
