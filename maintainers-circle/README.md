# Maintainer's Circle

Initially [proposed here](https://github.com/cncf/sig-contributor-strategy/issues/1).

Once a month, we welcome you to a maintainers circle: a peer group that will 
meet with scheduled topics, ample discussion, and networking time for fellow 
reviewers, approvers, maintainers, and other core leaders of CNCF projects. This
is a time for you to stay connected, learn from and with each other, and 
discuss topics that are close to you. We'll have a 100 person capacity for each 
event and depending on demand, may re-run the session. The capacity is set to
make sure everyone that wants an interactive experience vs a lecture can have 
one. 

The only contract of the members of each circle is to abide by the CNCF Code of 
Conduct, be kind, open as you'd like, and committed to hearing others out. 
Everyone will have a chance to participate in whatever activity is set forth in 
that meeting. 

## Goals:
Bring CNCF project maintainer* together to:
- Collaborate on strategic issues; tackling size:L OSS challenges together
- Listen (to build better programs, relationships, and sustainability efforts)
- Share best practices
- Participate in peer coaching and seek guidance  
- Highlight successes

*What/Who is a maintainer? There are a lot of meanings within the community.  
A maintainer is anyone recognized as a maintainer or in a core role of a CNCF 
project by
that project's standards and governance. You can maintain code, docs, policy and
 more, but you are making decisions.
Relevant CNCF project examples:  
- [containerd](https://github.com/containerd/project/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md#maintainership) 
lists maintainers and code reviewers as key role
- [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/master/MAINTAINERS.md)
lists maintainers in a MAINTAINERS.md file
- [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/community-membership.md)
doesn't use the word maintainer but uses an OWNERs file method for ownership by
listing reviewers and approvers

We recognize the term does not apply across the board perfectly. Maintainers
is an umbrella succinct term that covers many of your roles and inclusivity.

Important note: CNCF has a pool of listed maintainers for each project that vote
 on behalf of their project in TOC elections. Some projects have more maintainer 
 roles than this and the Circle welcomes all decision makers. 

## Where

In-person as soon as we can at the next face-to-face KubeCon (TBD)

Accidental Evangelist with Jérôme Petazzoni 

In 2013, Jérôme was an SRE manager when he accidentally became Docker's first 
evangelist. He had a vague idea of what an evangelist does: author blog posts, 
deliver conference talks, write abstracts about himself in the 3rd person. 
(Sounds like stuff you have to do, too?) 
But he didn't know how much he was supposed to do. How many meetups and 
conferences should one attend per day, week, month, year? Tracking progress and 
setting goals can be tricky when one switches to an entirely different career. 
Join us for a converation with Jerome and two break out sessions on how to 
manage this, track it, and not burn yourself out.

**First half** (first 30)  
Background and lead into first break out "how do you measure yourself?"  

**Second half** (second 30)  
What targets to set? What are the things that you might be a bottleneck on?  
Delegate.

Inclusive Language: For You as a Maintainer and Your Project  
  
**Registration** is an emoji reaction to the invite on the future thread in 
#maintainer-circle  
  
Notes from session: https://hackmd.io/vzRv5CyITSKfy2n9LTwM5w  

**First half** (first 30)
In 2020, Stephen Augustus and Celeste Horgan helped found the Inclusive Language
 Initiative. This expands the work they've been doing in the Kubernetes 
 community around removing harmful language in software and open source. They 
 follow up with us on the broader initiative and what they've been working on.

**Second half** (second 30)
Stephen and Celeste will guide you through the thought process of removing one 
piece of harmful language in your projects. You'll work with a small breakout 
group to brainstorm the possible touchpoints and understand the scope of the 
changes for yourself.  

### First one:  
December 17, 2020

**First half + breakouts:**
In 2017, Dorothy Howard spoke at SciPy on the research and effects of burnout on
 FOSS maintainers. She follows up with us on what’s happened since conducting 
 new and ongoing qualitative research and interviews with maintainers on 
 burnout, mental health, and software sustainability sponsored by the Ford/Sloan
  Foundations and the NSF. After a 20minute talk, Dorothy will seed the audience
   questions about burnout as you break out into small breakout rooms with your
    fellow maintainers in a 15minute session. 

**Second half + breakouts:**
We'll have a fireside chat with Aaron Crickenberger, Emeritus Kubernetes
Steering Committee Member, co-chair of SIG-Testing, and subproject owner in
multiple SIGs, about his experiences with burnout. It's been a 5 year journey 
with Kubernetes; we'll hear some of the realistic and honest ways Aaron tackles
time management and self care while steering huge ships. In this 15 minute
session, you can ask questions live to Aaron as a group, and then breakout 
into final small groups of the session.

           - round of short intros [name/project name] before discussion  
:25-:45 - second speaker (most likely a CNCF maintainer)  
:45-:05 - second breakout session   
:10-:15 - wrap up
